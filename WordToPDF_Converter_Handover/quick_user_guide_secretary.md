## Steps to Use

1.  **Open the Program:** Double-click the `main.exe` file on your desktop or in its folder.
2.  **Add Word Files:**
    *   Drag your Word documents (or folders containing them) directly into the large white list area in the middle of the program.
    *   Or, click the "Add Word Files..." button at the top left and select your Word documents.
3.  **Choose Where to Save PDFs:**
    *   Drag the folder where you want to save the PDF files directly into the input box next to "Output PDF Directory:".
    *   Or, click the "Select Directory..." button and choose a folder.
4.  **Select PDF Naming Style:**
    *   In the "PDF Naming Rule:" dropdown menu, choose how you want your PDF files to be named:
        *   "Original Name": PDF files will have the same name as your Word files.
        *   "Remove Square Brackets": PDF file names will automatically remove `[content in brackets]`.
5.  **Start Conversion:**
    *   Click the large blue "Start Batch Conversion" button.
    *   The program will start converting, and you'll see progress messages at the bottom.
6.  **View Results:**
    *   Once conversion is done, a "Conversion Summary" window will pop up, telling you which files were successfully converted and which failed. Click "Close" to dismiss it.
7.  **Done!** You can find your converted PDF files in the output folder you selected.

## If you encounter issues
*   If the program says "Word Application" cannot start, please check that Microsoft Word is installed on your computer.
*   If a file cannot be converted, please check if that Word file is currently open. If so, close it first.
