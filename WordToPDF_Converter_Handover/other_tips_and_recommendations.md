# 6. Other Tips and Recommendations

1.  **Microsoft Word Dependency is Core:**
    *   Reiterate that the program's operation **absolutely depends** on Microsoft Word being installed on the target machine. Without Word, the program cannot perform conversions.
    *   When deploying or distributing, make sure to clearly communicate this to users.

2.  **COM Automation Stability:**
    *   COM automation via `pywin32` can sometimes be fragile. While the program already enhances isolation and stability by launching independent `Word.Application` instances for each thread, Word application hangs or COM errors can still occur.
    *   **Best Practice:** Ensure Word documents are correctly closed (`doc.Close(False)`) after each conversion, and the Word application is quit (`self.word_app.Quit()`) and COM objects released (`del self.word_app`) when Worker threads finish.
    *   If frequent COM errors are encountered, consider adding a short delay (`time.sleep()`) between tasks for each Worker thread to give the Word application some buffer time.

3.  **Windows File Path Length Limit (MAX_PATH):**
    *   Windows systems have a total file path length limit of approximately 255-260 characters. The program already includes a check (`if len(final_pdf_full_path) > 255:`), but users should still be mindful of avoiding excessively long paths or file names.
    *   If such errors occur, advise users to shorten the output directory path or the original Word file names.

4.  **Enhanced Logging:**
    *   Current logs are primarily displayed in the GUI. For production environments or debugging, it's recommended to also write logs to a file. This can be achieved by adding a file handler from the `logging` module within the `_log` methods.
    *   For example, in the `_log` methods of `BatchConverter` and `ConversionWorker`, in addition to `self._log_callback`, you could add `logging.info(...)`.

5.  **Potential Performance Optimizations:**
    *   **Number of Threads:** The `num_threads` parameter is currently defaulted to 4. This is an empirical value; the optimal number depends on the machine's CPU cores and RAM. Too many threads can lead to system resource exhaustion and actually decrease performance. Benchmarking on different hardware is recommended to find the optimal value.
    *   **Word Application Startup Cost:** Launching each `Word.Application` instance incurs some overhead. For very small batches, single-threading might be faster. However, for large batches, the benefits of multi-threading are clear.

6.  **Future Feature Expansion Suggestions:**
    *   **More Naming Rules:** For example, adding date prefixes/suffixes, custom string prefixes/suffixes.
    *   **Overwrite Option:** Allow users to choose whether to overwrite existing PDF files instead of automatically renaming them.
    *   **Progress Bar:** Add more detailed progress bars for each file or the entire batch in the GUI.
    *   **Configuration File:** Allow users to set default output directory, default naming rule, number of threads, etc., and save these settings to a configuration file (e.g., `.ini` or `.json`).
    *   **Support for Other Office Applications:** If conversion of Excel or PowerPoint to PDF is needed, `word_to_pdf_converter.py` would need to be extended to include COM automation logic for `Excel.Application` or `PowerPoint.Application`.
    *   **Handling Corrupted Word Files:** Word COM can sometimes hang when dealing with severely corrupted files. Consider adding a timeout mechanism when opening documents, or attempting to use Word's built-in repair functionality (if the COM interface allows).

7.  **PyInstaller Packaging Notes:**
    *   When using PyInstaller, `pywin32` often requires special handling. The `main.spec` file should already contain the necessary hooks.
    *   If the packaged executable fails to run or encounters COM errors, check PyInstaller's logs and ensure that the `pywin32` hook files (`hook-pywintypes.py`, `hook-win32com.py`) are correctly included in your PyInstaller installation.
    *   Remember to re-run `pyinstaller main.spec` to generate a new executable after any code changes.
